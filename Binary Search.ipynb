    "# Binary search is a search algorithm that runs in O(log⁡n) in the worst case, where n is the size of the search space. \n",
    "# For binary search to work, your search space usually needs to be sorted. \n",
    "\n",
    "# If you have a sorted array arr and an element x, then in O(logn) time and O(1) space, binary search can:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find the index of x if it is in arr\n",
    "# Find the first or the last index in which x can be inserted to maintain being sorted otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's the idea behind binary search:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's say that there is a sorted integer array arr, and you know that the number x is in it, but you don't know at what index.\n",
    "# You want to find the position of x. Start by checking the element in the middle of arr. \n",
    "# If this element is too small, then we know every element in the left half will also be too small, since the array is sorted.\n",
    "# Similarly, if the element is too large, then every element in the right half will also be too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can discard the half that can't contain x, and then repeat the process on the other half. \n",
    "# We continue this process of cutting the array in half until we find x.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is how binary search is implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Declare left = 0 and right = arr.length - 1. These variables represent the inclusive bounds of the current search space at any\n",
    "# given time. Initially, we consider the entire array.\n",
    "# While left <= right:\n",
    "# Calculate the middle of the current search space, mid = (left + right) // 2 (floor division)\n",
    "# Check arr[mid]. There are 3 possibilities:\n",
    "# If arr[mid] = x, then the element has been found, return.\n",
    "# If arr[mid] > x, then halve the search space by doing right = mid - 1.\n",
    "# If arr[mid] < x, then halve the search space by doing left = mid + 1.\n",
    "# If you get to this point without arr[mid] = x, then the search was unsuccessful. \n",
    "# The left pointer will be at the index where x would need to be inserted to maintain arr being sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Because the search space is halved at every iteration, binary search's worst-case time complexity is O(log⁡n).\n",
    "# This makes it an extremely powerful algorithm as logarithmic time is very fast compared to linear time.\n"

    "This approach is quite different from the previous approaches. The characteristics of this problem are a good fit for the dynamic programming solution hence, it's easy to overlook the idea of using binary search. This problem satisfies the property that we can guess the answer (the minimum largest sum subarray value) and check if that value was too high or too low, thus narrowing our search space. It requires a different perspective to think of this approach, but after realizing that this problem is a candidate for a binary search solution, it becomes easier to implement than the previous approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem is to find the minimum largest subarray sum with m subarrays. Instead of finding the answer directly, what if we try to guess the answer (say X), and check whether this particular value could be the largest subarray sum with m subarrays. If this is possible, we can check all values for X≥0, and the first value that satisfies the condition will be the answer. Thus, by repeatedly solving the following problem, we can find the minimum largest subarray sum needed to split nums into m subarrays:"

Similarly, if it's not possible for a value X it will not be possible to have m or fewer splits for any value less than X."
