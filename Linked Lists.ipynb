    "The main advantage of a linked list is that you can add and remove elements at any position in O(1)O(1). The caveat is that you need to have a reference to a node at the position in which you want to perform the addition/removal, otherwise the operation is O(n)O(n), because you will need to iterate starting from the head until you get to the desired position. However, this is still much better than a normal (dynamic) array, which requires O(n)O(n) for adding and removing from an arbitrary position.\n",

So while an array has O(1)O(1) indexing, a linked list could require O(n)O(n) to access an element at a given position."
