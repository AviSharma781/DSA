If a node is at index i, then its children are at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2. When elements are added or removed, operations are done to maintain the aforementioned property of parent.val <= child.val. The number of operations needed scales logarithmically with the number of elements in the heap, and the process is known as \"bubbling up\"."
