    "# Binary search is a search algorithm that runs in O(log⁡n) in the worst case, where n is the size of the search space. \n",
    "# For binary search to work, your search space usually needs to be sorted. \n",
    "\n",
    "# If you have a sorted array arr and an element x, then in O(logn) time and O(1) space, binary search can:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find the index of x if it is in arr\n",
    "# Find the first or the last index in which x can be inserted to maintain being sorted otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's the idea behind binary search:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's say that there is a sorted integer array arr, and you know that the number x is in it, but you don't know at what index.\n",
    "# You want to find the position of x. Start by checking the element in the middle of arr. \n",
    "# If this element is too small, then we know every element in the left half will also be too small, since the array is sorted.\n",
    "# Similarly, if the element is too large, then every element in the right half will also be too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can discard the half that can't contain x, and then repeat the process on the other half. \n",
    "# We continue this process of cutting the array in half until we find x.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is how binary search is implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Declare left = 0 and right = arr.length - 1. These variables represent the inclusive bounds of the current search space at any\n",
    "# given time. Initially, we consider the entire array.\n",
    "# While left <= right:\n",
    "# Calculate the middle of the current search space, mid = (left + right) // 2 (floor division)\n",
    "# Check arr[mid]. There are 3 possibilities:\n",
    "# If arr[mid] = x, then the element has been found, return.\n",
    "# If arr[mid] > x, then halve the search space by doing right = mid - 1.\n",
    "# If arr[mid] < x, then halve the search space by doing left = mid + 1.\n",
    "# If you get to this point without arr[mid] = x, then the search was unsuccessful. \n",
    "# The left pointer will be at the index where x would need to be inserted to maintain arr being sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Because the search space is halved at every iteration, binary search's worst-case time complexity is O(log⁡n).\n",
    "# This makes it an extremely powerful algorithm as logarithmic time is very fast compared to linear time.\n"
