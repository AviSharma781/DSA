We want to store the elements in a way that when the maximum element is removed, we know the second maximum, and when that element is removed, we know the third maximum, and so forth. This should also be updated on new elements being added. Let's say that the window was [5, 3, 7, 1]. Then the order of maximum elements would be [7, 5, 3, 1]. What happens if we add a 6? We no longer care about the 5, 3, or 1. Because the 6 came after them, it won't be removed before them, and since it is larger, there is no chance that the 5, 3, or 1 will ever be a maximum.\n",

Thus, a monotonically decreasing data structure is what we should aim for (we remove elements smaller than new ones = the newest element is the smallest element). Should we use a stack or a queue? The problem describes a sliding window, which we know adds elements on the right and removes them from the left - this suggests a queue since operations are happening at opposite ends. However, the logic of removing elements smaller than the current number needs to happen from the right when we're talking about monotonic logic. Therefore, we will be adding and removing from the right, and removing from the left as the window tightens - this means we should use a double-ended queue (deque) for efficient O(1)O(1) operations."
